	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of the input. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, ensuring faster execution even for large inputs.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to run relative to the input size. It is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), which indicates that the memory usage grows linearly with input size.</p>
